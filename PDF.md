# Treasury Management System - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

I have developed a comprehensive Treasury Management System designed specifically for B2B fintech operations in the African market. This system addresses the critical need for multi-currency account management, real-time transaction processing, and robust financial controls that modern treasury operations demand.

## Product Vision

My vision is to create a production-ready treasury management platform that enables businesses to efficiently manage their financial operations across multiple currencies (KES, USD, NGN) while maintaining the highest standards of security, compliance, and user experience.

## Core Product Requirements

### 1. Multi-Currency Account Management

**Requirement**: I need to support seamless management of accounts across three primary African currencies.

**Implementation**:

- Real-time balance tracking for KES, USD, and NGN accounts
- Support for different account types (M-Pesa, Bank, Wallet, Corporate)
- Visual currency indicators with proper formatting
- Account overview dashboard with consolidated balances

**Business Value**: Enables businesses to manage diverse currency portfolios efficiently, reducing operational complexity and improving financial visibility.

### 2. Advanced Transaction Processing

**Requirement**: I must provide instant and scheduled transfer capabilities with cross-currency support.

**Implementation**:

- Instant fund transfers between any accounts
- Future-dated transaction scheduling
- Automatic FX conversion using live market rates
- Comprehensive transaction validation and error handling
- Realistic transaction fee calculation based on African market standards

**Business Value**: Streamlines treasury operations, reduces manual intervention, and ensures accurate cross-currency transactions.

### 3. Live Exchange Rate Integration

**Requirement**: I need real-time exchange rates to ensure accurate currency conversions.

**Implementation**:

- Integration with multiple exchange rate APIs (primary and fallback)
- Automatic rate updates every 5 minutes
- Rate caching for performance and reliability
- Visual rate display with market information
- Realistic trading spreads for accurate pricing

**Business Value**: Provides transparency in FX conversions and ensures competitive rates for treasury operations.

### 4. Transaction Reversal System

**Requirement**: I must implement a secure and auditable transaction reversal mechanism.

**Implementation**:

- One-time reversal per transaction to prevent abuse
- Exact amount protection ensuring only transferred amounts are reversed
- Balance validation before reversal execution
- Complete audit trail with separate reversal transactions
- Visual indicators for reversed transactions

**Business Value**: Enables error correction while maintaining financial integrity and regulatory compliance.

### 5. Professional Dashboard & Analytics

**Requirement**: I need comprehensive visibility into treasury operations and performance metrics.

**Implementation**:

- Real-time account totals and transaction counts
- Currency breakdown analysis
- Recent activity monitoring
- Advanced transaction filtering and search
- Responsive design for mobile access

**Business Value**: Provides actionable insights for treasury decision-making and operational efficiency.

## Technical Assumptions

### Architecture Decisions

I have made the following technical assumptions based on modern web development best practices:

1. **Frontend Framework**: React 19 with functional components and hooks for optimal performance
2. **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for consistent, responsive design
3. **State Management**: Custom hooks with proper separation of concerns
4. **Data Handling**: Precise decimal calculations for financial accuracy
5. **Performance**: Optimized rendering with useCallback and useMemo

### Exchange Rate Management

I assume the following for exchange rate handling:

1. **Primary API**: exchangerate-api.com for live rates
2. **Fallback API**: fxratesapi.com for reliability
3. **Update Frequency**: 5-minute intervals with caching
4. **Offline Handling**: Cached rates used when APIs are unavailable
5. **Spread Application**: 0.5% spread for realistic trading conditions

### Security & Compliance

I have implemented the following security assumptions:

1. **Transaction IDs**: Non-sequential, unique identifiers for security
2. **Balance Validation**: Strict overdraft prevention
3. **Audit Trails**: Complete transaction history maintenance
4. **Reversal Controls**: Single reversal per transaction to prevent abuse
